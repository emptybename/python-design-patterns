# Prototype Pattern

- Complicated objects are not designed from scratch.
    - They reiterate the existing designs.
- Any existing(partially or fully constructed) design is a prototype.
- We make a copy(clone) of the prototype and customize it
    - Require 'deep copy' support
- We make the cloning convenient(via Factory)
