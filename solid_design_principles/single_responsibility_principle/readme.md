# Single Responsibility Principle OR Separation Of Concern:

The idea is very simple. 
- If you have class then the class should have its primary responsibility.
- Don't overload your object with so many responsibility. This is called God object anti-pattern.

GOD object is where we put too many responsibilities which later hard to manage.

So SRP prevents to make GOD objects.
