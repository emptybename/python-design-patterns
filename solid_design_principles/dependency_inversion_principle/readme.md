# Dependency Inversion Principle

- High level modules should not depend on low level modules.
  Both should depend on abstraction. 

- Abstraction should not depend on details. But details should depend on abstractions.

- The interaction between high level module and low level module should be thought of as an abstract interaction b/w them.
