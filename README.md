# Python-Design-Patterns
Traditionally design patterns are classified into three main categories:
1. Creational
2. Structural
3. Behavioural


# Creational Design Patterns:
1. Deals with the creation of classes and objects.
2. They serves to abstract away the specifics of classes. So that we would be less dependent on  their exact implementation.

OR

- Deals with the creation(construction of object).
- Explicit(constructor) vs Implicit(DI, reflection, etc).
- Wholesale(single statement) vs Piecewise(step-by-step)

# Structural Design Patterns:
1. Structural design patterns are used to assemble multiple classes into bigger working structures.
2. They are very useful for creating readable, maintainable, layered code, 
especially when dealing with external libraries, legacy code, interdependent 
classes or numerous objects.
3. Stress the importance of good API design
