# Flyweight Design Pattern

- It is used for space optimization
    - Avoid redundancy while storing data
    - e.g.
        - Plenty of users with identical first and last name
        - No sense in storing same first and last name over and over again
        - store a list of names and reference to them


So flyweight is space optimization technique that lets us use less memory by storing externally the data associated 
with similar objects
